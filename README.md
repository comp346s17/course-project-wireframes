Team Name: wireframes
Website Name: linkbucket
Team Members: Vihan Agarwal, Eric Huang and Xi Zhang

Description:
Our website is best described as a fancy bookmark bar. Currently, a bookmarks bar isn’t the best place to store a ton of links. Well, it is but it can get cluttered and although you can create bookmark folders, it isn’t the most fun way to categorize links. Our website will “embellish” the bookmark bar into a website. Users can create an account and store different lists or “buckets” of links. On logging in to the website, a user will be shown all his “buckets” and will be given the option to create a new one. On clicking on a certain bucket a fresh page is loaded with all the links, which can be edited or deleted. There will also be an option for users to add a new link. We are also going to implement the ability to share a certain list of links on social media.

Project Requirements:
Our project is going to require two data models: for the user and for the “buckets”. We may also add a third “links” model to describe each link (if it’s an image/video/audio etc or the domain). We will need the following views in conjunction with our models:
Login view
Sign up view
Home view
A specific “bucket” view
For these views we will be required to display content dynamically based on which user is logged in and which “bucket” is opened. 

Roles and Responsibilities:
We will each have a say in all the parts of the website, but in order to meet the deadlines work needs to be split up. Xi will focus on implementing all the models and the signup and login pages. Vihan will work on implementing the front end for the bucket page as well as all the backend logic. Eric will work on the front end for home page and work on the wireframe. 

Timeline:
4/5 - Complete wireframing and meet to finalize how everything should look.
4/6 - Wireframes and Design Mockups should be complete

4/13 - Basic Layouts for all pages must be completed. With styles for the simple pages like login implemented.
4/20 - The layouts must be stylized using bootstrap or foundation. All front end must be finalized. Basic server side code should be implemented as well.

4/27 - All server side code should be completed. Website should be up and running.


Requested Support/Concerns:
We are concerned that we may not know how to implement the share feature. Furthermore, we are also unsure how to go about detecting the “type” of a link. But these are only concerns we have now because we haven’t tried to implement these features yet. Honestly, the website seems pretty straightforward.
